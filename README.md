# Unmix-Photo-Gallery
<i><b>*Compatible with Android devices only</b></i>

A separate gallery that allows the user to manage pictures that they do not want to be mixed into their default phone gallery.

This is a private gallery, separated from your phone's gallery, tailored to store temporary pictures (eg: study / work related). It is easy, simple and light to organize and manage these pictures. It makes your photo management less tedious. Keep track of these junk photos and delete them once you are done with them.
